Open terminal and type following command

1. npx create-next-app@latest ./  (./ means create app in current location)
2. go to app/ page.tsx and delete everything and type rafce and press enter. 
    It will give a boiler plate
    (If rafce doesnt work that means you have not installed es7+ vscode extension for react 
    . so install es7+ ension on vs code)
